In this way, the post will be categorized to the right place for other users.\n",

The 2nd level is more like a mezzanine where you can gaze down on all the pple getting down. 3rd floor is for VIP and you can look up through the part of the clear dance floor on the 4th level (ladies beware unless you're wanting to show off your goods).  4th level has a much larger dance area, but is ALWAYS still packed!  5th level is the rooftop and a great escape from the crowds or to catch some fresh air.

It's a cute little BYOB.  We had the special appetizer, an amazing gnocchi dish with a meat sauce (lamb, beef, and something else?) that exploded with flavor.

Dancing goes on all 4 but the most happening spots are on the 1st and 4th to get your groove on. The 2nd level is more like a mezzanine where you can gaze down on all the pple getting down. 3rd floor is for VIP and you can look up through the part of the clear dance floor on the 4th level (ladies beware unless you're wanting to show off your goods).  4th level has a much larger dance area, but is ALWAYS still packed!  5th level is the rooftop and a great escape from the crowds or to catch some fresh air.  Great view of the strip too.  Usually has a live band playing more mellow music.\nUpdate: Wah! Guess I'm a ghetto girl since its one of my more preferred places to do some booty dancing",

Also located right off the path of the Pinellas Trail.  I usualyl wind up dining in the sunroom area that's totally airconditioned so you're not uncomfortable.  Has a great bistro/cafe feel to it.  Food is excellent and I'm never disappointed.  Staff is also very friendly, but watch out for the crowds during peak dining times.",

The frito misto appetizer is more than enough for two, with perfectly fried seafood, including calamari and shrimp.  The trademark gnocchi is ethereal and is served as a side or as a main dish.  The only caution is the veal, which could be of better quality; have the same dishes with chicken and you won't be disappointed.",

is frigid and weird they have weird things going on they try to sell you all kinds of stuff like used cds they are obviously really selfimportant because everything has a really special grooveground label on it i just plain hate this place and their service is so slow its funny they only have one person working at a time and this poor sucker has to make all this crazy stuff by himself ive been there about times and left pissedoff in each instance their menu is ridiculous really expensive desserts mocktails souffles and everything is overpriced also they do not have soymilk i believe its on the menu but they dont have any i am never going to grooveground again even though its within blocks of my home</td><td>2.0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>one fo the best places to get your dance on in my opinion cover can range from free so where do i start there are essentially levels to this place dancing goes on all but the most happening spots are on the st and th to get your groove on the nd level is more like a mezzanine where you can gaze down on all the pple getting down rd floor is for vip and you can look up through the part of the clear dance floor on the th level ladies beware unless youre wanting to show off your goods th level has a much larger dance area but is always still packed th level is the rooftop and a great escape from the crowds or to catch some fresh air great view of the strip too usually has a live band playing more mellow music update wah guess im a ghetto girl since its one of my more preferred places to do some booty dancing</td><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>this place stinks like medicine i dont know what it is but it has smelled that way for years what the fuck is it this is the most highbrow grocery store in the area like total fance gourmet foods but they have a few good things going for them deli you can make a sandwich that is pretty fucking fly pizza shop they make a good slice cokes good cokes from the fountain in a wax cup none of that bullshit throwaway plastic novelty shit coffee pretty rad coffee for good price hot sauce has one of the better selections of hot sauces in town mostly gimmick stuff though fruit way cheaper than food coop for a banana still the stink ruins it that and the total foofery</td><td>3.0</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>not sure about the previous reviews vegetarian statement but chloe is definitely delicious its a cute little byob we had the special appetizer an amazing gnocchi dish with a meat sauce lamb beef and something else that exploded with flavor the halibut was good and plentiful served on delicious heirloom tomatoes with microarugala our other dish was goat cheesericotta ravioli with edamame toasted pine nuts and mushrooms it was a rich dish dessert was a berry cobbler the berries were yummy but the vanilla ice cream stole the show i cant believe i forgot to ask if they made it or if i could buy that brand somewhere</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>every time i go up to santa barbara to go walking on state street and no not as in streetwalking lolmore like shopperusingi make a stop at the santa barbara brewing company during the fall especially since there seems to be so many more sporting events on tvthis place rocks plenty of big screens and tvs showing a vast array of stuff for your viewing pleasure they bre their own beer on sitethe blonde hef ipa red and stout are their poular onesand you can get a little sampler of if you cant make up your mind definitely order yourself a side of their garlic and rosemary fries with the side of ranchyou and your tummy will thank me later your loved ones however might not</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>so i remember when this place used to be a beautiful restaurant even if the food wasnt always teh greatest then they turned the main entry into a sam ash sniff luckily the main portion of the place has been converted into a special events venue for weddings private parties and proms the gardens are very beautiful and from the looks of it theyre restoring thigns bit by bit where to start its got greek styling written all over it with roman columns statues and greenery grape motifs flowing everywhere there is just so much for me to say but my favorite room is the grand ballroom with the double staircase its gorgeous and opulent woot several rooms are available for use</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>i will respond to two interesting reviews of this city with my own celebration of its mediocrity and hope to inspire others to help me make it better here the most common praise i hear from people new to tucson is that the weather is great and they like the sight of the mountains even though this is probably just a saysomethingniceordontsayanythingatall the weather is actually convenient you can do things outside on any day of the year and there are mountains and therefore parks trails etc in every direction its a myth that its too hot to do things outside in the summer in az other places are hotter theres the u of a here which makes things better and a nearly unlimited diversity in types of places to eat buy crap hang out get drunk be offended etc as a vacation spot tucson is one of the best places to chill without a beach especially if you are really old and like to golf and has some very nice resorts the only really important tourist stop is the desert museum which is not like the museums youre thinking of the one complaint i get most often from people visiting or who have recently moved is that the people at bars are not friendly and even sometimes rude tucson whats your problem star i also get a lot of complaints that there is a lack of a young professional population which is very true</td><td>1.0</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>abby katie opened this nice airy boutique about a year ago they hand make all of their clothing on site and it is really cute stuff their jackets are beautifully tailored their pants are flattering and comfortable and their tops are just plain hot it always feels great to buy from a local business but it feels even better to buy a bunch of hand made well designed clothes from such sweet ladies</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>theyre not digital yet so the turn around can be anywhere from to days if youre lucky you are able to see your photos right after the photoshoot on the computer but youve still gotta wait a week or their sheets and portrait packages are cheap if you remembered to print out your coupons their backgrounds are very basic and even boring compared to what the other digital studios now offer but the photo quality seems to be nicer than the digital ones</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>spanish restaurant thats been an establishment in the area as far back as i can remember the atmosphere is very lively and bustling but romantic i am in love with their chicken and yellow rice and their pompano palillote almendrina thats a filet of pompano w house stuffing cooked in a parchement bag its so good i prefer this version over the one they sell at columbia good sangria made by a recipe they used in their family restaurant in madrid dessert menu has a great selection and really yummy this place is kinda pricey tho so not for every day dining</td><td>1.0</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>love this place especially for breakfast or brunch nestled in the cute lil downtown area of dunedin this place is located across the street from kellys for just about anything also located right off the path of the pinellas trail i usualyl wind up dining in the sunroom area thats totally airconditioned so youre not uncomfortable has a great
